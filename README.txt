The MacCode repo is a repository hosted on Google Code with a bunch of stuff in it. Notables:

- PSMTabBarControl
- Aquatic Prime

Everything is 3 clause BSD.


This also includes source code from other projects in the opensource-bsd-externals directory.

Instructions for checking out code:

If you want the external projects checked out (projects not hosted on Google Code, but which are useful)

svn co http://maccode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ maccode

If you do not want the externals (they can take up a bit of space)

svn co http://maccode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ maccode --ignore-externals 


Getting a commit bit.

Email Chris Forsythe http://trac.adiumx.com/wiki/the_tick and he will get you access. All code you submit needs to be 3 clause BSD.
