-- Sample tables that can be used to store everything received in an
-- eSellerate XML order notice.  Except where noted, field types and sizes are
-- based on "OrderNoticeDS.xsd" and "OrderNoticeDS.xsd Reference.pdf".
-- The tables were designed to target MySQL 4.1.18, and may or may not need
-- customizing for other database engines.

-- These tables include everything from the XML post (except where noted).
-- However all fields except ORDER_NUMBER (in OrderInfo) and SKU_ID (in OrderLines)
-- are allowed to be NULL, so you can choose to just not populate fields you're not interested in.
-- In particular if you just want to set up a password-retreival database, you might
-- want to leave out everything except serial number and email address.
